# Add a new app

## Step 1

Create a new folder with `index.tsx` in the `src/apps` directory, write the logic there. You need a unique slug for the app, which is used as the app id, such as `color_picker`.

You need use MUI v7. And you can find some pre-built components in the `src/components` directory if needed.

## Step 2

Create a new file with `README.en-US.md` in the `src/apps` directory, write the README for the new app. Use frontmatter to define the app's metadata.

Don't forget to add a SEO-friendly description and keywords.

For example:

```md
---
name: "GTA Cheat Codes"
status: "stable"
icon: "/icon/book_white.png"
description: "Complete collection of cheat codes for All GTA games"
channel: gaming
network: true
seoOptimizedDescription: "Free comprehensive database of GTA cheat codes for all platforms. Find cheats for GTA 5, GTA 4, San Andreas, Vice City and GTA 3. Easy to use, no ads."

```

When choosing icon, you have two options:

1. Use a pre-built icon from the `public/icon` directory.
2. Use our dynamically generated icon API: `src/pages/api/icon.ts`

Also add a README.zh-CN.md file then.
